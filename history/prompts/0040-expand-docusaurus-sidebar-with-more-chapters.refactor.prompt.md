## Prompt

## Response snapshot

Successfully modified file: E:\Humanoid_Robotics\Humanoid_Robotics\book-docs\sidebars.js (1 replacements).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `sidebars.js` file has been further expanded with additional placeholder chapters, enriching the content structure of the Docusaurus project with more topics relevant to Humanoid Robotics and AI.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: book-docs/sidebars.js was modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now create the actual content files for these newly added chapters.
- 🧠 Reflection: The task involved interpreting a request to add "more context" and translating that into specific, relevant chapter topics for a technical documentation project, then correctly integrating them into the Docusaurus sidebar configuration.
